# Final Project Minor Programming

## Our fight against the Plastic Soup

Name: Jikke van den Ende  
Student number: 10787593  
Application goals: Inform people in general about world wide plastic pollution
of the oceans, and create awareness of the size of this problem.

## Purpose project
Even though worldwide plastic pollution is a well-known problem, every year more than eight million tonnes of plastic is being dumped in the ocean. The problem is the rapid growth in plastic production in combination with a not so rapid growth in different ways of managing the plastic waste, like recycling. By illustrating these outrageous numbers of plastic production, waste generation and pollution of the oceans, the aim of this project is to help people realise the magnitude of the problem and hopefully do something about it themselves.

External code: For creating the datamap I inspired a lot of my code on a project by [Mark diMarco](http://datamaps.github.io/). For the transition in the linechart I checked a project from [Mike Bostock](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5649592), and I also used some code from [Patrick Sier](https://bl.ocks.org/pjsier/fbf9317b31f070fd540c5523fef167ac). The layered barchart is inspired on the code of this project of [Mike Bostock](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/b5935342c6d21928111928401e2c8608).  
Images: The plastic in sea image comes from [Waking Times](https://www.wakingtimes.com/2018/03/21/the-amount-of-plastic-in-oceans-will-triple-within-seven-years-says-major-report/). The turtle image comes from [WNF rangers](https://rangers.wnf.nl/info/7-tips-om-minder-plastic-te-gebruiken.htm).  
Data: Almost all the datafiles I got from the article of [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution). The data about the surface plastic particles by ocean basin also comes from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/surface-plastic-particles-by-ocean).
