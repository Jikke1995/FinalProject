## Description
The visualisations from this project illustrate different number in worldwide plastics production, plastic waste generation and plastic pollution of the oceans. It shows how the plastic production has risen over the last few years, to what extent countries all over the world contribute to the global plastic waste generation and how much of their waste is maneged/mismanaged. A visualisation only about the USA shows how much (for example) recycling rates have risen over the last few years, but also that the number of plastic particles floating in the oceans basins is still outrageous.  

The screenshot below shows a map of the world. While hovering over a country (China in this case) it will show the user the plastic waste generation by the whole country for 2010, and below in the piechart it illustrates how many percent of the global plastic waste is generated by that country. The second layer of the piechart displays the proportion rates between managed and mismaneged waste generation for the selected country.
