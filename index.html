          <h1>Plastic pollution of the oceans</h1>
          <p>Even though worldwide plastic pollution is a well-known problem,
            every year more than 8 million tons of plastic is being dumped in
            the ocean. The production of plastic has risen for more than 300
            million tonnes since 1970. Future perspectives show that this will
            only become more and more. More plastic generation will
            automatically lead to more plastic waste, but that doesn't have to
            mean that this waste will end in our oceans. There are several ways
            (recycling, combusting with Energy Recovery) to manage the usage
            and re-usage of plastic. But for now the rates of these ways of
            managing plastic waste are still to low. One of the reasons is that
            big companies (responsible for a lot of plastic waste) have high
            power and for them it can be expensive to recycle their plastic
            waste instead of dumping it. There are only a few small (in
            comparison) organisations that take action. Most important, there's
            a lack of awareness in general. People need to become more aware of
            the size of the problem of plastic pollution and what might happen
            if nothing is going to change.

          <h2>About this project</h2>
          <p> The datavisualisations on this website will inform you about
            the numbers of plastic waste all around the world. First it displays
            the plastig generation over the last 60 years, to see how much that
            has grown. Next, it gives you insights in what the share of each
            country is in the global plastic waste production, and how much of
            their own plastic waste they manage/mismanage. Lastly, it shows the
            amount of plastic particles floating in the global oceans. The aim
            of these visualisations is to help you realise the magnitude of the
            problem of plastic genetartion, waste and pollution and it will
            hopefully inspire you to do something about is yourself.
