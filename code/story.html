          <h2>Plastic pollution of the ocean</h2>
          <p>Even though worldwide plastic pollution is a well-known problem, every year more
          than 8 million tons of plastic is being dumped in the ocean. The production of plastic has risen for more than 300 million tonnes
          since 1970. More plastic production leads to more plastic waste, eventually
          leading to the plastic soup in the ocean becoming bigger and bigger. The problem
          is that big companies (responsible for the plastic waste) have much power and
          there are only a few small (in comparison) organisations that take action.
          There's a lack of awareness in general. People need to become more aware of the
          size of the problem of plastic pollution and what the consequences are if
          nothing is going to change.</p>
          <br>
          <h2>About this project</h2>
          <p> The datavisualisations on this website will inform you about
            the numbers of plastic waste all around the world. It gives you insights
            in what the share of each country is in the global plastic waste
            production, and how much of their own plastic waste they manage/mismanage.
            It shows the amount of plastic particles floating on the global oceans,
            and of which particles these 'plastic soups' consist. The aim of these
            visualisation is to help you realise the magnitude of the problem of plastic
            production and it will hopefully inspire you to do something about is yourself. </p>
