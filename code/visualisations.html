          <h2> Worldwide plastics production </h2>
          <p>First of all, to understand the size of the problem of plastic pollution,
          it's necessary to realise how rapid the growth of global plastic production
          has been over the last 65 years. When the first completely synthetic plastic
          was produced in 1907 by Leo Baekland, it took until about 1950 before the
          worldwide plastics production increased explosively. About that time the world
          produced 2 million tonnes of plastic per year, but it increased nearly 200-fold to
          381 million tonnes in 2015.

            <h2> Worldwide plastic waste generation </h2>
            Prior to 1980 the percentage of plastic that was recycled was negligible, almost 100% was discarded. Since
            1970 rates increased on average by about 0.7% per year. That means that
            in 2015 more or less 20% of the plastic waste was recycled. Besides the
            25% that was incinerated, 55% of the global plastic waste was discarded.
            Below, you can take a look at the plastics generation of the USA over the
            same amount of years as in the image above. It shows the amount of plastic
            that was recycled, landfilled or combusted with Energy recovery. There was
            a lack of data to show this for the whole world, but it's some sort of
            representative for how the global proportion rates are at this moment, and
            how they changed over the last few years.

            per capita of a country or the plastic waste genaration of the whole
            country for the year 2010. Hovering over a country the exact data.
            Please realise that these numbers do not account for differences in
            the management of waste (like recycling, incineration or dumping).
            However, clicking on a country will give you the proportion rates
            of managed (recycled/incinerated) and mismanaged plastic waste
            (dumping) of that country in the second layer of the piechart below.

          <h3>Plastic pollution of the oceans </h3>
          <p> Plastic waste that is mismanaged means that it is either littered
            or inadequately disposed. It is at high risk of entering the ocean
            via rivers where it has been dumped, via wind when it has been dumped
            somewhere without watching, or tidal transport. But when it enters
            the oceans, where does it go? Big soups of plastic arise due to oceanic
            surface currents and wind patterns, because of the buoyancy of most
            of the plastic particles. These are called gyres. In the figure below
            you can see the amount of surface plastic particles of each ocean
            all over the world.

            <p> This visualisation doesn't even show the plastic waste in oceans
                more deeply. As you can see by these big amounts of plastic particles
                floating around, the plastic pollution isn't a problem you can easily
                resolve. And it isn't about cleaning the oceans, it's about dealing
                with the cause of the pollution. It's about awareness of the generation,
                usage and wasting of plastics.
